# Fake News Identification

### Problem 1 
#### Build a classifier that predicts if a given news is disinformation or real
Notebook 1 '1. FakeNewsClassifier_Train.ipynb' contains the EDA, Pre-processing and Model training for the disinformation classifier. 
In this notebook, the train data is used throughout.

Notebook 2 '2. FakeNewsClassifier_Test.ipynb' is a copy of the first notebook which is then re-run on the test data. 
The Neural Network predictions are in this notebook. 

### Problem 2
#### Cluster disinformation news into fine grained clusters where the similar narratives are in the same cluster.
Notebook 'DisinformationClustering.ipynb' contains the EDA, Pre-processing, Vectorising and Topic Modelling.
